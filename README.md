Progress of learning how to make instant-messaging possible in Java.

Hello! Welcome to this repository, My name is Andy and I recently started learning how to program. This repository is a marker to
show my progression of learning in terms of Java. Here I aim to create a sort of "instant-messaging" style text interface. This is 
in a very alpha state, feel free to give me suggestions as to how I can improve my code!
